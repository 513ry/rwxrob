Title: Rethinking Chronological Blogging
Subtitle: Titles are Good Things
Query: true

Summary:
  Blogging started out as "web logging" and blog entries all just has
  time stamps. Eventually, people started putting titles on their blog
  entries. These days we even have [art-directed
  blogs](https://duck.com/lite?kae=t&q=art-directed blogs) which is just
  web speak for fancy magazine articles designed for the web. I've
  always been one to blurt out whatever and just be content to have a
  time stamp. But recently the inability for me to find my own stuff has
  caused me to rethink this overall approach. In fact, I've concluded
  titles are good.

Titles provide the fastest way for people to find the topic you are
writing about. When I'm too lazy to give a post proper tags and such at
least the title will be searchable, both locally and from the web. 

I've found that this goes for videos as well. These days making a video
is so easy you just have to mark it off, highlight it, and export it. I
don't even bother with a description or tags but I do spend time
thinking about the absolute perfect title containing the *most*
important keywords. 

In fact, as I conclude this short blog entry Imma go make a video about
it right now. It just occurred to me that when I create the two at the
same time. I can provide a link in the description to the write up of
the blog entry that goes with it. That way I save time on the
description write up and am always able to formulate the thoughts before
I make a video about them, which makes the video better. I'm reminded of
a video I watched form Bryan Lunduke where he read from his blog *for*
the video. I suspect that is just the best way to combine "vlogging"
with blogging.
