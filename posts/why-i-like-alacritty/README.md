Title: Why I Like Alacritty
Subtitle: Fastest and Easiest to Configure, Also Rust
Query: true
Summary:
  Alacritty is the fastest terminal emulator I have ever used. It uses GPU acceleration in ways that others don't. It also boasts a dynamic YAML configuration file that automatically updates the terminal when the file it changed by default. This allows amazing, scriptable configurations such as opacity, full screen, and more.  I regularly use Alacritty as an example of a program that is *perfectly* in the sweet spot for Rust development. And it sure doesn't hurt that [\@undead_leech](https://twitch.tv/undead_leech) regularly joins our [live stream](https://twitch.tv/rwxrob).

*Update: I no longer use Alacritty. Gnome-Terminal is plenty fast and
already there. No need to update. Also Alacritty has bugs and still
lacks some support for UTF-8, I've discovered. Also I do a lot of
transparency adjustment and that is just plain easier from a GUI slider
widget*
