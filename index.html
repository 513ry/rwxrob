<p>Code is art. Good code is like the enigmatic innards of a fine 16th century timepiece, a good coder not unlike the artisan obsessed with its beauty, complexity, and elegance.</p>
<p>Yeah — I admit, I do romanticize technology as an art form that transforms our lives for the better. God knows I love talking about it, which is why I most enjoy empowering others by helping them learn it.</p>
<p>I funded and started <a href="https://skilstak.io">SKILSTAK</a> in May 2013 to explore how technology can be used for personal empowerment. I’ve always observed that learning best happens in the lab, not the lecture hall. So I built a humble lab into a small company and have enjoyed helping hundreds since to find their way through the tech jungle.</p>
<p>Live coding and conversation with my friends who join <a href="https://rwxrob.live">rwxrob.live</a> has become my favorite tech-related past-time. I’ve logged thousands of hours and have been working on a <a href="https://youtube.com/rwxrob">beginner boost video series</a> for some time to help others get started. Topics have included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applying autodidactic habits of successful technologists</li>
<li>Programming from the command line in Bash, Web, Go, and Python</li>
<li>Exploring edge computing and embedded systems development in C</li>
<li>Learning cloud native architecture and applications development</li>
<li>Applying cybersecurity skills in a learning environment</li>
</ul>
<p>I love to read and write and maintain a list of <a href="books">books</a> I’ve read, reviewed, and want to write.</p>
<h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>
<p>I’ve been down-sizing my private, in-person mentored community gradually in an effort to reach out to thousands through streaming and writing. This means I am aggressively seeking full-time employment that supports this goal doing CTO-type work and/or development in Go (golang) creating command line, terminal UI, systems and backend applications as well as cloud native applications involving Docker, Kubernetes, gRPC, ProtoBuf, et cetera. I’m also considering opportunities to write pentesting and security auditing software as I did for IBM as an SRE there.</p>
<h2 id="work-history">Work History</h2>
<p>📃 My full curriculum vitae and professional referrals and recommendations are available as <a href="cv">a YAML file</a> which I use as a base from which to build more specific resumes and job applications when needed.</p>
<p>Before starting the company that currently employs me, I spent 14 years at IBM making software and caring for the systems it ran on. Perl, Bash, Shell, Python, C/C++, Ruby, BigFix and Java helped meet the enterprise compliance requirements of IBM’s core customers. Before being recruited to the IBM Tivoli team I designed and developed a GPG-secured core communication protocol running on over 53,000 productions servers across hundreds of key IBM accounts saving millions in server management but I consider the “Thanks Awards” received from peers for helping them learn Linux and other skills to be my greatest achievements while there.</p>
<p>Before IBM I worked at Nike and still honor the “There is No Finish Line” award my peers at Nike gave me for creating Swooshnet, Nike’s first intranet portal. Capturing the Nagano Winter Olympics live on the first-ever internal blog was one highlight of my career, more even than the live chats I created and ran for CEO Phil Knight, John McEnroe, Michael Johnson, and others.</p>
<h2 id="reasonable-transparency">Reasonable Transparency</h2>
<p>While I’m a big fan of privacy and regularly champion companies and products that promote it, I’ve also chosen to be reasonably transparent online. I figure at this point in my life it is a way to help others out who might want to learn from my successes and failures. This is why I’ve included so much personal information including my <a href="notes">notes on different topics</a>, <a href="quotes">favorite quotes</a>, a <a href="personality">personality summary</a>, <a href="conduct">personal code of conduct</a>, and <a href="log">reverse chonological log</a>. (I’ve always hated the term blog.) Nothing I’ve written represents any entity with which I have ever been associated.</p>
