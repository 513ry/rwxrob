# Books I Want to Write

I've always been a fan of books even though technical books regularly
suffer from falling out of date. Books are *still*  a better
comprehensive resource than wikis because they are written with a
consistent voice and reader in mind and are (usually) edited better.

That said, the books I write will always be free online with paper
equivalents in print (like No Starch Press).

### Deep Dives

* The Hidden Power of Bash

### General Technology

This category of books contains stuff of general interest and import to
most technologists. Focus is on practices, habits, and knowledge rather
than specific technologies.

* Autodidactic Habits of Successful Technologists
* Good to Gig, Surviving the Radical New Sharing Economy
* Works on My Machine, Modern Collaborative Developer Practices

### Survival Guides

Survival guides are filled with nothing but practical step-by-step
instructions for accomplishing specific tasks (which some prefer to call
*recipes* or *procedures* or just *algorithms*.) These living guidebooks
are as easy to access as they are to keep up to date digitally as
knowledge bases. When technologists forget how to do something they grab
one of these. 

You can think of these guides as *code for brains* written in natural
language syntax. Each contains a procedural program that can be
interpreted and executed by human brains (provided they have booted up
and been given sufficient cognitive resources to process the
instructions).

* Survive the Linux Command Line
* Survive Text Editing with Vi (Vim)
* Survive Coding a Web Site
* Survive Writing in Pandoc Markdown
* Survive Programming in Go
* Survive Shell Scripting with Bash
* Survive Docker Containers
* Survive Managing Source with Git
* Survive Programming in C

*The titles use a verb in gerund form unless it would be "Using" in
which case it is simply dropped.*

### Beginner Boosts

Beginner boosts are comprehensive learning material designed to
supplement and envelope the survival guides by providing additional
context and knowledge which connects and informs the specific task-based
instruction in the guides. Boosts include both practical and memorable
exercises (mini-projects) which can be repeated until they are mastered
to hone specific techniques and improve efficiency.

  * Linux Terminal Beginner Boost
  * Web Design Beginner Boost
  * JavaScript Beginner Boost
  * Pandoc Beginner Boost
  * Bash Beginner Boost
  * Go Beginner Boost
  * C Beginner Boost
