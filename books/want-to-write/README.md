# Books I Want to Write

I've always been a fan of books even though technical books regularly
suffer from falling out of date. Books are *still*  a better
comprehensive resource than wikis because they are written with a
consistent voice and reader in mind and are (usually) edited better.

That said, the books I write will always be free online with paper
equivalents in print (like No Starch Press).

### General Technology

This category of books contains stuff of general interest and import to
most technologists. Focus is on practices, habits, and knowledge rather
than specific technologies.

* Autodidactic, Habits of Successful Knowledge Workers
* Good to Gig, Surviving the Radical New Sharing Economy
* Works on My Machine, Modern Collaborative Developer Practices
* Terminal Velocity, Mastering the Fastest Human-Computer Interface
* Coding for Self-Empowerment, Programming with Purpose  
* Lessons Learned Over a Decade of Helping Others Learn
* Learning PEGN, The Parsing Expression Grammar Notation

### Beginner Boosts

Beginner boosts are designed to make you dangerous; after completing a
boost you should be able to say "I know enough to be dangerous" and
prepared to dive more deeply into the skill or topic. You will have the
confidence to take risks, but with the understanding that you have a lot
left to master. In other words, you are ready to do more and know just
enough to know whether you want to learn more or not.

* Linux User Beginner Boost
* Vim Text Editing Beginner Boost
* Web Design Beginner Boost
* JavaScript DOM Beginner Boost
* Pandoc Markdown Beginner Boost
* Go Programming Beginner Boost
* Essential Python Programming
* Essential SQL Programming
* Essential Shell Scripting
* Essential Perl Scripting
* Essential Docker for Containers
* Essential Git Version Management with GitHub
* Essential C Programming
* Essential Assembly Programming

*The titles use a verb in gerund form unless it would be "Using" in
which case it is simply dropped.*

### Beginner Boosts

Beginner boosts are comprehensive learning material designed to
supplement and envelope the survival guides by providing additional
context and knowledge which connects and informs the specific task-based
instruction in the guides. Boosts include both practical and memorable
exercises (mini-projects) which can be repeated until they are mastered
to hone specific techniques and improve efficiency.

  * Linux Terminal Beginner Boost
  * Web Design Beginner Boost
  * JavaScript Beginner Boost
  * Pandoc Beginner Boost
  * Bash Beginner Boost
  * Go Beginner Boost
  * C Beginner Boost
