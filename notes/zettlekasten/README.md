# Zettelkasten

* "Thoughts" not "notes"
* "Connection" over "collection"
* No categories
* Keyword tags
* Register
* Arbitrary branching
* Doable with paper index cards only

## What If

* Machine learning applied to note to identify best keyword tags

## What Luhmann Did

While working, playing, creating, and researching (aka living):

1. Maintain a set of cards (or notebook with pages divided into card
   size) for the day, perhaps one digital and another on paper (for
   while you are in the bathroom shitting or showering). Just use the
   date for a title. Write anything that needs to be captured without
   any formal thought about how it relates to anything else. Indulge in
   guilt-free cognitive masturbation throughout the day as you let your
   brain do whatever the fuck it wants. Make sure you can keep up. Use
   shorthand if needed. Add a time if the thought is chronologically
   significant.

Set aside some time to enjoy the cognitive porn you've recorded. You got
some really good stuff there so you'll likely want to do this at least
once a day:

1. Create peer nodes with other sub nodes (if needed)
1. Create additional related sub nodes in sequence (if needed)
1. Check if nodes already fit into other graphs and add
1. Create links / references between relevant nodes
1. Add keywords to register

## Main Techniques

Power of Zettelkasten is in the *combination* of the following main
techniques used together. Without one or the other the system falls
apart:

1. Sequences and Branching
1. Keyword Tags and Register
1. Links and References 

## Links and References

TODO: move this to its own note

Links are inline internal references to other notes within the same
