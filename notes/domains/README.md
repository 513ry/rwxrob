# Domain Names

I'm addicted to camping on domain names. There is something about the
potential they contain that overwhelms any practical measure of time I
have to actually do anything with them. I'm always dreaming of stuff to
build.

Domain|Summary
-|-
`afk.works`|Association of Federated Knowledge Workers
`know.sh`|Something cool and `curl`-able
`mim.directory`|Public knowledge base registry
`mim.sh`|Terminal-based SaaS
`mim.works`|Open core software development shop
`pegn.dev`|Parsing Expression Grammar Notation
`readme.world`|Alias for `mim.directory`
`robs.io`|Old `io` vanity domain
`rwx.gg`|Main public knowledge base
`rwx.tv`|Syndicated live content
`rwxrob.live`|Personal live stream
`skilbot.io`|Former home of SkilBots
`skilbots.io`|Former home of SkilBots
`skilstak.io`|Main private mentoring site
`skilstak.sh`|Private mentoring terminal access
`skilz.dev`|No idea, but just too cool

There are many more. Those are the only ones worth listing.

## Domain: `robs.io`

This is my `io` vanity domain (back when `io` was all the rage). I've
since decided that longevity is more important than any other factor,
which means giving people a URL that has the best chance of outliving
me. Hence the `github` domains. This also makes is *much* easier to help
others get started with a personal/professional profile. It was a stoke
of simple genius for GitHub to add support for this stuff.

I'm in the process of offloading it to other domains:

Use|Domain
-|-
Email|`rwx.gg`
Site|`github.com/rwxrob`

### Why `github.com/rwxrob` and not `rwxrob.github.io`? 

Because I want people to first find me on GitHub where they can decide
to follow me to get the latest updates and notifications automatically.
They can also provide issues when something is wrong.

Eventually, I will activate the `rwxrob.github.io` version as well and
provide a link to a "prettier" version for easier reading, but that is
the only reason.

### Keeping Jekyll for Profile Static Site Generation

Look. I know Jekyll is old, perhaps the first static site generator in
history, but it just works out of the box with everything on GitHub
without the need to add or manage any other service or domain. These
days it is also hosted on a CDN.

## Domain: `rwx.gg`

I started out with this one as a place to hold all the content for live
streaming instruction and education. The idea was that potentially
others would be able to create things under this domain while
maintaining editorial control.

I'm not thinking this is the name of whatever professional self
publishing I end up doing.
