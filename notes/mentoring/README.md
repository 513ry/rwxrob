Sunday mornings we [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/7s35TRB) voice chat about how to mentor, be mentored, and find a mentor. Notes from the weekly chats are posted here. Watch for links to YouTube videos as well. Stuff is in reverse chronological order so the latest is on top.

* Fixed 
  * "I'm not capable." 
  * "I don't have that talent."
* Growth
  * "Nothing is impossible with enough work."

When do you hit people with reality vs hope?
  * There is a limit.

Find someone who inspires you to want to learn.

  * People who know aren't necessarily people who "inspire."
  * Find someone you can see as a person and a professional.

Avoiding Dunning-Kruger

  * You *were* the smartest kid in the room.

Passion and motivation

  * Connect the dots.

"It sounds like you ... perhaps that's not what you meant. When you are out there you don't want to sound like that."

Giving yourself permission to follow passion.
