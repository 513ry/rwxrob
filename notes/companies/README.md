# Really Great Companies

Here's my opinionated list of companies that have demonstrated how
amazing they are in every way (or at least almost every way). I would be
proud to recommend them to anyone in my private mentored community
(including myself):

1. Digital Ocean
1. Hashicorp
1. Bloomberg
1. [Ad Hoc](https://adhoc.team)
2. InfluxData

Any company paying for full-time employment working on open source
projects like the following:

* Gitea
* PostgreSQL
* PEGN
* KEG

## But what about ... ?

A lot of good companies didn't make the list simply because they have
part of them that are simply impossible to ignore.
