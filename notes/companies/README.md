# Really Great Companies

Here's my opinionated list of companies that have demonstrated how
amazing they are in every way (or at least almost every way). I would be
proud to recommend them to anyone in my private mentored community
(including myself):

1. Digital Ocean
1. Hashicorp
1. Bloomberg
1. [Ad Hoc](https://adhoc.team)
1.. InfluxData

I'd add to the list any company paying for full-time employment working
on open source projects like the following:

* Gitea
* PostgreSQL
* PEGN
* KEG

## But what about ... ?

A lot of good companies didn't make the list simply because some part of
their organization is doing bad that is simply impossible to ignore,
like Google and Facebook that still make 95% of their revue by selling
its users personal lives to the highest bigger and hiring professional
psychological propagandists to pump up their engagement time through
active addiction to their service and who have been caught calling
under-age children with access to their parents credit cards "whales" in
internal email.

## Companies That Suck

But here's a short list of absolutely horrible companies I active
encourage people to avoid at all costs. Good people who work at these
places have to do all kinds of mental gymnastics and rationalization to
accept their paychecks.

One popular excuse is, "we can change it from the
inside." 

Yeah, just no. Work someplace else. 

Most won't do the right thing. The money is just too good. Their
complicit, but their cognitive dissonance keeps them from 
giving a shit.

* Google
* Facebook
* Palantir

Did I offend you? Oh, I'm so sorry.
