# Kubernetes Notes

Kubernetes is mandatory learning for everything I'm planning from
full-time enterprise work, to building a pentesting scanning cloud
on-prem at home. It's been recommended (by those who know) that I can go
directly for a Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) which
will give me information on how dev are deploying to k8s along with k8s
training.

I'm also going to be directly working with KNative (an abstraction API)
as a priority.

## Documentation

Apparently you can use this document on the exam itself, so this is
*mandatory* learning if for nothing more than the structure of where
stuff is so I can find it quickly:
