# Kubernetes Notes

I've decided not to pursue any Kubernetes formal certifications, but to
instead make a lot of stuff with it that I can take pictures of and
share online as I learn and play with it. I'm sure that should be plenty
to prove proficiency to anyone who really cares to know my *true* level
mastery.
