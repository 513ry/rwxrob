# Kubernetes Notes

Kubernetes is mandatory learning for everything I'm planning from
full-time enterprise work, to building a pentesting scanning cloud
on-prem at home. It's been recommended (by those who know) that I can go
directly for a Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) which
will give me information on how dev are deploying to k8s along with k8s
training.

I need to learn the following in order of priority:

1. Kubernetes (1.18 for now)
1. IStio/Envoy - config network L4/L7 proxy (even though linkerd might be better)
1. KNative - API abstraction
1. Seldon.io - AI models at scale in production
1. Prometheus - metrics collector in Go
1. ElasticSearch - just a log search engine

I'm also going to be directly working with KNative (an abstraction API) as a priority.

## Documentation

Apparently you can use this document on the exam itself, so this is
*mandatory* learning if for nothing more than the structure of where
stuff is so I can find it quickly:
