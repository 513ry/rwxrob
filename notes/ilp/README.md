# Individual Learning Plan

Here's my ongoing learning plan. This help me stay focused on 5-year
goals in every area including professional and personal development. 

## Priorities

This plan is based on the following priorities:

1. **Providing for family.** The entire reason for getting more formal
   work is to support my family both financial (mortgage, education) and
   with insurance. My family is largely grown so these are far more
   important considerations than my being around with them physically.

1. **Remote work.** I am 53 and Covid is raging (and will be
   for a long time after others think it has died down). I know for a
   fact that there are well paying jobs for remote workers because I
   fucking did it for more than 22 years. I'm not compromising on this
   point now or ever. If anything, I'll get an Air Stream and move close
   to the location for specific critical work when needed. This also
   allows me to travel while working during my non-retirement as a OG
   tech but modern digital nomad.

1. **Enterprise scale.** While I enjoy consulting for small and mid
   sized companies (having been one) it is the enterprise scale
   experience that translates into good mentoring opportunities to help
   others start their own careers.

1. **Clean separation between personal and professional.** What I do on
   my time is my fucking business and I don't want some micro-managing
   asshole to ask me something like "why are you not in bed yet." If I
   get the job done and don't besmirch my employer then my personal life
   is none of my employer's fucking business. They don't let me into
   their private board meetings and therefore have no right to invade my
   own equivalents. I also don't require being friends with my employer
   nor the people I work with, although I enjoy good comradery like
   anyone.

1. **Allow --- or even promote --- open community building and
   sharing.** No "we own you and every thought you have" work at all. I
   want to promote others. This is why I turned down good work that
   would have required me giving up the content I created for the
   company rather than releasing it to open source.

## Critical Path

Here is the critical path of skills that I need immediately and that are
effectively blocking other skills and knowledge learning later:

1. **Kubernetes.** An SRE SME in an interview
   answers "Kubernetes" as the most important skill to learn for that
   specific position within a successful large enterprise. Time to mock
   an on-prem physical enterprise cloud native infra in order to learn
   and demonstrate mastery. Also, this infra design is being used
   extensively for edge computing and IoT. I plan to get both the
   [CKA](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/) and the
   [KCAD](https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/)

1. **Containers for Software Deployment (Docker).** Need to be able to
   encapsulated everything for a multi-component application (DB + web
   server + middleware, or gRPC). Docker and Docker-Compose/Nomad/Crio
   are core skills for *all* enterprise software developers because this
   is how you hand things off to operations. "Tiered software
   applications development" is enterprise-y.

1. **Git for Team Software Development.** I need to be able to ably
   participate in any large software development project with multiple,
   capable, prolific contributors and be able to wrangle them
   contributing to my own open projects with zero dependency on any
   service provider. This enables self-hosting, bare repos, and other
   coordination techniques such as those used by the Linux and Git
   teams.

1. **GitHub Actions, CI/CD, Issues.** Even though I don't need them for
   my own projects many will use them and I will need thorough knowledge
   in order to contribute to others' projects. Jenkins? Travis?

1. **Enterprise Go Applications and APIs.** Cloud native APIs. Protobuf,
   gRPC, `net/http`, `html/template`, GraphQL, Oauth2, TUI (tview/cview,
   tcell, termbox), GUI lib of some kind (Fyne, Qt)


Way later:

1. **Erlang (Elixir)**
