# Individual Learning Plan

Want to become someone who is part of a cybersecurity critical emergency
response and root cause analysis operations team. (I don't think it's
called blue team.) Field operations? Digital Forensics Incident
Responder.

Here's my ongoing learning plan. This help me stay focused on 5-year
goals in every area including professional and personal:

1. **Git for Team Software Development.** I need to be able to ably
   participate in any large software development project with multiple,
   capable, prolific contributors and be able to wrangle them
   contributing to my own open projects with zero dependency on any
   service provider. This enables self-hosting, bare repos, and other
   coordination techniques such as those used by the Linux and Git
   teams.

1. **Containers for Software Deployment (Docker).** Need to be able to
   encapsulated everything for a multi-component application (DB + web
   server + middleware, or gRPC). Docker and Docker-Compose/Nomad/Crio
   are core skills for *all* enterprise software developers because this
   is how you hand things off to operations. "Tiered software
   applications development" is enterprise-y.

1. **GitHub Actions, CI/CD, Issues.** Even though I don't need them for
   my own projects many will use them and I will need thorough knowledge
   in order to contribute to others' projects. Jenkins? Travis?

1. **Enterprise Go Applications and APIs.** Cloud native APIs. Protobuf,
   gRPC, `net/http`, `html/template`, GraphQL, Oauth2, TUI (tview/cview,
   tcell, termbox), GUI lib of some kind (Fyne, Qt)

Way later:

1. **Erlang (Elixir)**
