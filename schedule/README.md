# Schedule

This is the weekly schedule I try to keep and publish so people can try
to sync up if they want to join me for live streaming or whatever.

## Weekdays

## Weekends

## Considerations

A few things to note about this schedule before you attempt anything
similar:

* I take meals while working as snacks or breaks.
* I'm able to check in with my family while I work and stream.
* I've been working from home since 1996.
* My wife and I sleep in separate bedrooms.
* I make sure to block all the light possible when sleeping.
* I've found that ineffective sleep is hurts my body and brain.

## "So when do you stream?"

Saturday and Sunday, 10am American/Eastern (-0500)

I also live stream as much as possible during anything marked Work,
Mentor, or Free as I am able, and as those I mentor gradually move on to
other things I plan to replace the Mentoring time completely with
structured live stream sessions.
