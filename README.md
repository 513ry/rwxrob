# Rob Muhlestein

Code is art. Good code is like the enigmatic innards of a fine 16th
century timepiece, a good coder not unlike the artisan obsessed with its
beauty, complexity, and elegance.

Yeah ‚Äî I admit, I do romanticize technology as an art form that
transforms our lives for the better. God knows I love talking about
it, which is why I most enjoy empowering others by helping them learn it.

I started [SKILSTAK](https://skilstak.io) in May 2013 (with my own
money) to explore how technology can be used for personal empowerment.
I've always observed that learning best happens in the lab, not the
lecture hall. So I built a humble lab into a small company and have
enjoyed helping hundreds since to find their way through the tech
jungle.

Participating as a member of the [rwxrob.live](https://rwxrob.live)
community has become my favorite tech-related past-time. I've logged
many hours live streaming and working on a [beginner boost video
series](https://youtube.com/rwxrob) to help others get started. Topics
have included:

* Applying autodidactic habits of successful technologists
* Programming from the command line in Bash, Web, Go, and Python
* Exploring edge computing and embedded systems development in C
* Learning cloud native architecture and applications development
* Applying cybersecurity skills in a learning environment

## Availability

I've been down-sizing my private mentored community gradually and I am
currently seeking full-time employment specifically doing CTO-type work
and/or development in Go (golang) creating command line, terminal UI,
systems and backend applications as well as cloud native applications
involving Docker, Kubernetes, gRPC, ProtoBuf, et cetera. I'm also
looking for opportunities to write pentesting and security auditing
software as I did for IBM but written in the Go programming language.

## Work History

üìÉ My full curriculum vitae is available as [a YAML file](vitae.yml).  
‚ò∫Ô∏è  Professional referrals and recommendations are [also
available](refer.yml).

Before starting the company that currently employs me, I spent 14 years
at IBM making software and caring for the systems it ran on. Perl, Bash,
Shell, Python, C/C++, Ruby, BigFix and Java helped meet the enterprise
compliance requirements of IBM's core customers. Before being recruited
to the IBM Tivoli team I designed and developed a GPG-secured core
communication protocol running on over 53,000 productions servers across
hundreds of key IBM accounts saving millions in server management but I
consider the "Thanks Awards" received from peers for helping them learn
Linux and other skills to be my greatest achievements while there.

Before IBM I worked at Nike and still honor the "There is No Finish
Line" award my peers at Nike gave me for creating Swooshnet, Nike's
first intranet portal. Capturing the Nagano Winter Olympics live on the
first-ever internal blog was one highlight of my career, more even than
the live chats I created and ran for CEO Phil Knight, John McEnroe,
Michael Johnson, and others.

## Personal Site

I maintain a *very* personal web site at <https://robs.io> with a
sort-of running stream of consciousness I call notes (I hate the term
blog). Nothing I've written there represents any entity for which I have
ever worked professionally.
