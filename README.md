# Rob Muhlestein

Code is art. Good code is like the enigmatic innards of a fine 16th
century timepiece, a good coder not unlike the artisan obsessed with its
beauty, complexity, and elegance.

Yeah â€” I admit, I do [romanticize](type.png) technology as an art form
that transforms all our lives for the better. God knows I love [talking
about it](https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality), which is
why I most enjoy helping others empower their own lives by learning it.

I started [SKILSTAK](https://skilstak.io) in May 2013 to explore how
technology can be used for personal empowerment. Learning happens in the
lab, not the lecture hall. So I built a learning lab into a small
company and have enjoyed helping hundreds find their way through the
tech jungle.

Extrovert that I am, participating as a member of the
[rwxrob.live](https://rwxrob.live) community has become my favorite
tech-related past-time, even more than playing Witcher 3. I've logged
many hours live streaming and working on a [beginner boost video
series](https://youtube.com/rwxrob) to help others get started. Topics
have included:

* Applying autodidactic habits of successful technologists
* Programming from the command line in Bash, Web, Go, and Python
* Exploring edge computing and embedded systems development in C
* Learning cloud native architecture and applications development
* Applying cybersecurity skills in a learning environment

## Availability

I've been down-sizing my private mentored community gradually and I am
currently seeking full-time employment specifically doing CTO-type work
and/or development in Go (golang) creating command line, terminal UI,
systems and backend applications as well as cloud native applications
involving Docker, Kubernetes, gRPC, ProtoBuf, et cetera. I'm also
looking for opportunities to write pentesting and security auditing
software as I did for IBM but written in the Go programming language.

## Work History

My full work history is available as [a YAML file](rob-muhlestein.yml)
(from which I can dynamically create customized resumes and CVs).

Before starting the company that currently employs me, I spent 14 years
at IBM making software and caring for the systems it ran on. Perl, Bash,
Shell, Python, C/C++, Ruby, BigFix and Java helped meet the enterprise
compliance requirements of IBM's core customers. Before being recruited
to the IBM Tivoli team I designed and developed a GPG-secured core
communication protocol running on over 53,000 productions servers across
hundreds of key IBM accounts saving millions in server management but I
consider the "Thanks Awards" received from peers for helping them learn
Linux and other skills to be my greatest achievements while there.

Before IBM I worked at Nike and still honor the "There is No Finish
Line" award my peers at Nike gave me for creating Swooshnet, Nike's
first intranet portal. Capturing the Nagano Winter Olympics live on the
first-ever internal blog was one highlight of my career, more even than
the live chats I created and ran for CEO Phil Knight, John McEnroe,
Michael Johnson, and others.
