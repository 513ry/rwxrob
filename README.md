Code is art. Good code is like the enigmatic innards of a fine 16th
century timepiece, a good coder not unlike the artisan obsessed with its
beauty, complexity, and elegance.

Yeah â€” I admit, I get a little obsessed.

I love coding and helping others learn. I started
[SKILSTAK](https://skilstak.io) in May 2013 to do both. Participating as
a member of the [rwxrob.live](https://rwxrob.live) community has become
my favorite tech-related past-time. I've logged many hours live
streaming and working on a [beginner boost video
series](https://youtube.com/rwxrob) to help others get started
including:

* Applying autodidactic habits of successful technologists
* Programming from the command line in Bash, Web, Go, and Python
* Exploring edge computing and embedded systems development in C
* Learning cloud native architecture and applications development
* Applying cybersecurity skills in a learning environment

My 14 years at IBM were spent making software and caring for the systems
it ran on. Perl, Bash, Shell, Python, C/C++, Ruby, BigFix and Java
helped meet the enterprise compliance requirements of IBM's core
customers. Before being recruited to the IBM Tivoli team I designed and
developed a core communication protocol running on over 53,000
productions servers across hundreds of key IBM accounts saving 
millions in server management. I consider the "Thanks Awards" received
while working at IBM among my greatest achievements.

Before IBM I worked at Nike and still honor the "There is No Finish
Line" award my peers at Nike gave me for creating Swooshnet, Nike's
first intranet portal. Capturing the Nagano Winter Olympics live on the
first-ever internal blog was one highlight of my career, more even than
the live chats I created and ran for CEO Phil Knight, John McEnroe,
Michael Johnson, and others.
