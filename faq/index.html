<div class=container>  <h1 id=title>Frequently Answered Questions</h1>
<p>You ask. I answer, usually.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-you-using-for-chat-why-not-twitchyoutube">What are you using for chat? Why not Twitch/YouTube?</h2>
<p><a href="chat">chat.rwx.gg</a> is <code>##rwx.gg</code> (for now, soon to be <code>#rwx.gg</code>) on IRC freenode.net.</p>
<p>IRC is superior to Twitch and YouTube for many reasons. In fact, all Twitch chat <em>is</em> IRC under the hood:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not controlled by any corporation</li>
<li>Reliable chat provider that won’t go away</li>
<li>Works even when logged out</li>
<li>Maintains chat history</li>
<li>Zero chat lag</li>
<li>Well established community</li>
<li>Tons of <em>different</em> tools to pick from</li>
<li>Completely safe when used properly</li>
<li>Opens up access to wider IRC community</li>
<li>Emphasizes communication over spamming</li>
</ul>
<p>YouTube provides the <em>essential</em> ability to create chapters and bookmarks that are labelled and easily used by viewers. YouTube also provides wider access, full transcoding, and a far superior API for all things (except live chat which sucks).</p>
<p>You can watch my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/rwxrob/search?query=twitch">full video rant</a> against Twitch if you prefer.</p>
<h2 id="wait-why-arent-you-talking-or-on-video">Wait, why aren’t you talking or on video?</h2>
<p>These days (now that I’ve decided to do everything on <em>the</em> YouTube with monetization) it’s hard to <em>not</em> find me without my camera on. Apparently, people like to see people in videos. Who would have guessed? In the past I’ve had other sorts of modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Work Mode.</em></strong> When I really just need to get stuff done and not really pay attention to the chat other than just as a fun diversion as if I had people working in the office next to me. In this mode I’m more inclined to just listen to ambient sounds and chill music and not even notice questions let alone answer the obvious ones. I code best with chill music (as opposed to death metal or, oh my god, techno).</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Voice Mode.</em></strong> When I’m wanting to discuss something over chat or rant you will hear my voice and (sometimes) see me on video. This is when I’m dedicated to interacting with people on the stream. There will almost never be music on in this mode since it is difficult to hear anyone with music on over their voice and it messes up YouTube closed captioning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Rubber-Duck Mode.</em></strong> This is a form of <em>Work Mode</em> but involves me talking through a particularly hard part of the design as if talking to a rubber-duck (called “rubber-ducking” by those in the trade). You just get to listen in on it. Sometimes I will switch from <em>Work Mode</em> to this mode rather quickly. When I do I drop the music and turn on the mic and usually go right back to the music later.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="isnt-this-the-same-web-site-style-as-rwx.gg">Isn’t this the same web site style as <a href="http://rwx.gg">rwx.gg</a>?</h2>
<p>Why yes, yes it is. Laziness is a virtue.</p>
<h2 id="how-are-you-doing-that-transparency-whats-your-window-manager">How are you doing that transparency? What’s your window manager?</h2>
<p>First of all, I use whatever window manager is on the system because I live in the terminal. I happen to have whatever comes with PopOS. It’s the default Gnome desktop manager, I think.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I full screen a <strong>Gnome-Terminal</strong> (but any terminal will work) and set the transparency. For me I just type F11 and it goes into full screen.</p></li>
<li><p>I find a good <strong>background video on YouTube</strong> that is okay with copyright and loop that in full screen as well.</p></li>
<li><p>I find a good <strong>sound effect or music YouTube video</strong>, again with no copyright restrictions, and loop that as well.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is a little hard to manage them. But I have gotten used to managing everything with Alt-Tab (Command-Tab for me) so I can switch between them fast enough when needed.</p>
<p>I have been really loving PopOS <code>Super</code> key window zooming so I can get a quick look at everything in real-time even while still displaying. This is particularly important when streaming with hotkeys for important things like hiding your screen to do scary stuff. You can tap <code>Super</code> just to glance at OBS to make sure the preview is what you expect before doxing yourself.</p>
<h2 id="what-font-do-you-use-on-your-terminal">What font do you use on your terminal?</h2>
<p>UbuntuMono Nerd Mono (for no particular reason). Terminal is set to 18 font size.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-reformat-paragraphs-like-that">How do you reformat paragraphs like that?</h2>
<p>I use the <code>gw</code> (cousin of <code>gq</code>) to do all my paragraph formatting usually combined with a <code>}</code> to select up to the next blank line, but sometimes with a <code>{</code> to select the everything above to the previous blank line (which is <em>essential</em> for formatting Go comments that cannot have a blank line before the actual code and the code gets mangled if you don’t).</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-get-your-keystrokes-to-show-on-the-screen">How do you get your keystrokes to show on the screen?</h2>
<p>A tool called <code>screenkey</code> that has been configured for streaming out of the way in the bottom right corner. If you do decide to use it, make sure to learn <code>control+control</code> or whatever to disable it so that you can reliably turn it off when entering any password or secret information (yes even KeePassXC or cut and pastes).</p>
<h2 id="what-editor-are-you-using">What editor are you using?</h2>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/420YRb3LVn8">Choose an Editor That’s Right for You</a></p>
<p>I’m a big <code>vi</code> user from before there was a <code>vim</code> so I have tried to keep with the <code>vi</code> purity as much as possible. Recently, however, I’ve realized that a lot of my favorite shortcuts and habits are actually vimisms that crept into my regular editing sessions. So these days you see me trying to adopt more of the things that only <code>vim</code> can do that <code>vi</code> cannot. For example, I had not even used a <code>vim</code> macro until October of 2020 and I’ve been using <code>vi</code> since 1996 or so.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-neovim-nvim">Why not NeoVim (<code>nvim</code>)?</h2>
<p>I <a href="https://rwx.gg/tools/editors/neovim/">hate NeoVim</a>. It’s a complete disaster. It has made ever wrong decision possible. It is a living testament to the reason Bram hates dealing with potential contributors who would put all the dumb crap into Vim if allowed. All I can say is …</p>
<p>God bless Bram Moolenaar.</p>
<h2 id="why-dont-you-like-oopjavac">Why don’t you like OOP/Java/C++?</h2>
<p>It’s not that I don’t like <em>true</em> OOP. I’ve just seen <em>class-based</em> OOP abused so much that agree with Brian Cantrill about the “dark times” of the 90s when it emerged. Here’s another explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.” – Joe Armstrong</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First let me say that there are many principles that are associated with OOP that are <em>not</em> in fact just OOP:</p>
<ul>
<li>encapsulation</li>
<li>polymorphism</li>
<li>separation of concerns</li>
<li>interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>These things are well-established best practices and present in <em>many</em> other languages with different paradigms.</p>
<p>But the <em>class-based</em> OOP primarily associated with Java and C++ and SmallTalk (originally) has been overwhelmingly proven to be a broken paradigm — especially single inheritance models.</p>
<p>What really pisses me off is how totally entrenched it has become in everything down to our AP computer science tests. The entire industry has been plagued by the largest marketing efforts ever done for a programming language ($500k for Java) and we are still seeing its massively negative affect all through the industry even today.</p>
<p>For those who <em>truly</em> want to understand this issue (and frankly most who ask me the question don’t) then watch the following videos completely before you <em>ever</em> breathe a word of question about this to me. Otherwise, you are just wasting all of our fucking time.</p>
<p>My favorite is this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrBQmIDdls4">video from Jim Coplien</a>:</p>
<p>Jim: “Who here is has ever done any object-oriented programming?”</p>
<p>Crowd sheepishly raises hands.</p>
<p>Jim: “Okay, you there, what language to you program in?”</p>
<p>Scared Coder: “Java”</p>
<p>Jim spitting and pointing: “Java is the <em>only</em> language in which you <em>cannot</em> write object-oriented programming code!”</p>
<p>Why all that?</p>
<p>Because no one even knows <em>what the fuck</em> true object-oriented programming even is. I didn’t. I drank the Kool-aide in the 90s big time. I even gave presentations at conference about Java. I coded thousands of lines of Java, and was burned by all the negative things that are not widely regarded as the problem. At one such conference one of the creators of Java was asked a telling question:</p>
<p>“If you could change one thing about the language what would it be?”</p>
<p>“Inheritance,” he replied.</p>
<p>The crowd roared with laughter because they thought he was kidding.</p>
<p>He wasn’t.</p>
<p>People throw the words related to OOP around like crazy because the gang of three dumb asses convinced the world that things like Java and C++ are <em>actually</em> object-oriented, but they <em>never</em> were. You cannot even code OOP in Java. In C++ you can, but you have to break from the ++ part and more of the C part.</p>
<p>There are two other great video references to these problems. My favorite is from <a href="https://youtu.be/HgtRAbE1nBM">Brian Cantrill</a> but <a href="https://youtu.be/QM1iUe6IofM">Brian Will’s video</a> is also <em>very</em> good, just less comedic.</p>
<p>So no jungle with your banana.</p>
<h2 id="whats-your-vim-theme">What’s your vim theme?</h2>
<p>Um, these days it is <a href="https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&amp;kp=-1&amp;q=gruvbox">gruvbox</a>, which is a better take on Solarized and softer on the eyes. All of that (and more) is in my <a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/-/blob/master/common/vim/vimrc"><code>.vimrc</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="where-did-you-get-that-musicbackground">Where did you get that music/background?</h2>
<p>Everything I use is from YouTube. You can find my playlists on <a href="https://youtube.com/rwxrob">my YouTube channel</a>. Most of it is copyright free streams .</p>
<h2 id="whats-up-with-that-ix-command">What’s Up with That <code>ix</code> Command?</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://ix.io" class="uri">http://ix.io</a> is the best terminal-centric pastebin alternative out there. I’ve made a video about it as well as a <a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/-/blob/master/scripts/ix">ix shell script</a> that makes using it a bit easier and writes to the clipboard with <code>xclip</code>.</p>
<h2 id="whats-your-hardwaresoftware-setup">What’s your hardware/software setup?</h2>
<p>Here’s my hardware and software applications that I rely on:</p>
<ul>
<li>PopOS!
<ul>
<li>Gets out of the way so I can get stuff done</li>
<li>No desire to futz with OS, been there, done that</li>
<li>Rock solid</li>
<li>It just works</li>
<li><code>apt</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gnome-Terminal
<ul>
<li>Alacritty proved too buggy, but otherwise was nice</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bash Shell
<ul>
<li>Universal, powerful</li>
<li>Tab completion</li>
<li><code>$CDPATH</code></li>
<li>Exported functions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>TMUX
<ul>
<li>Configured for <code>screen</code> finger-memory</li>
<li>Nested TMUX session
<ul>
<li>Two different sockets</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Main session</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Vim
<ul>
<li>Neovim is buggy and unnecessary</li>
<li>Prefer TMUX for panes to Vim panes</li>
<li>Best-in-class macros and shell integration</li>
<li>Blows the doors off VSCode for <em>most</em> things</li>
<li>Ubiquitous unlike Emacs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>WeeChat IRC to Twitch (not WeChat)
<ul>
<li>FIFO for comms.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-take-notes-like-that">How do you take notes like that?</h2>
<p>I use the <code>note</code> script that combines my <code>kn</code> script with a lazy <code>save</code> script for simple git commits. All of them (and more) are available in my <a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> for your perusing pleasure.</p>
<h2 id="how-are-you-doing-that-go-automated-test">How are you doing that Go automated test?</h2>
<p>It’s a combination of several simple shell scripts that run the test only when an important file changes in the current directory or any directory underneath it. You can get ideas from the following scripts in my <a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles">dotfile directory</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/-/blob/master/scripts/got">got</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/-/blob/master/scripts/gott">gott</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/-/blob/master/scripts/onchange">onchange</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/-/blob/master/scripts/haschanged">haschanged</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/-/blob/master/scripts/changed">changed</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some have suggested I should use the internal Linux events for this, but I prefer something based on <code>find</code> that works anywhere Bash, or even POSIX shell is installed (which would need some tweaking).</p>
<h2 id="how-are-you-searching-and-browsing-from-your-terminal">How are you searching and browsing from your terminal?</h2>
<p>It’s really just a combination of Lynx and Bash shell scripts, sometimes a little <code>curl</code> in there. Here are the links to the relevant files:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/-/blob/master/scripts/duck">duck</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/-/blob/master/scripts/google">google</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/-/blob/master/scripts/bing">bing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Then I just add the following aliases:</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>alias &#39;?&#39;=duck
alias &#39;??&#39;=google
alias &#39;???&#39;=bing</code></pre>
<p>Plus there are some videos on it I made a long time ago:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Vdd2MTv6vrs">Lynx Text Web Browser FTW!</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-lynx-and-not-w3m">Why <code>lynx</code> and not <code>w3m</code>?</h2>
<p>Because <code>lynx</code> is simply superior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better <code>vi</code> bindings</li>
<li>Faster since not downloading and positioning images (just stupid)</li>
<li>Older and better supported</li>
<li>Has its own mailing list</li>
</ul>
<p>But the <em>single</em> biggest advantage of Lynx is that it <em>keeps a consistent text flow on the screen</em>. I cannot overstate how important this subtle difference is. You won’t notice it until you have logged thousands of hours using it. But once you have you will find your eyes jumping and scanning much more efficiently over web pages in text form from Lynx than you ever could in <code>w3m</code>. This scanning ability is the <em>entire reason</em> for using a text based browser in the first place. I can search for full documentation on anything that an “intellisense” pop-up would tease you with in less time than it takes for the fucking pop-up to stop annoying you in your dumb-ass intellisense-enabled IDE. Very few people on planet Earth (including most inexperienced YouTubers with big mouths) will appreciate that difference, but I promise you, those that do <em>destroy</em> the research efficiency of the others.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-have-a-discord-how-can-i-message-you">Do you have a Discord? How can I message you?</h2>
<p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/9wydZXY">Yes.</a> And you can just DM me there.</p>
<h2 id="how-are-you-streaming-and-chatting-like-that">How are you streaming and chatting like that?</h2>
<p>It’s a combination of things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>WeeChat IRC client connected to Twitch in a nested TMUX pane so it stays even when I create a new window.</p></li>
<li><p>Streaming <a href="https://restream.io" class="uri">https://restream.io</a> with the bot enabled to messages appear to and from Twitch, YouTube, Periscope/Twitter, Discord and eventually LinkedIn (I hope).</p></li>
<li><p>OBS Studio (of course) which installed and worked without any problems or driver tweaking whatsoever on my PopOS distro.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/-/blob/master/scripts/screenkey">screenkey</a> tool positioned down in the corner displaying what I type.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="co-rant">
<p>I had to <em>write an email</em> to have my Twitch Affiliate status removed in order to be compliant with their shitty terms of service that says you have to wait 24 hours to put content on anything else. Then my subs couldn’t even unsub because the removed the button. Fuck that shit. Twitch can bite me. They are <em>lucky</em> to have my content. Fuckers. It’s clear where their priorities are: selling out for the quickest buck, not improving the world through education and engineering streams. Yeah, I’ve come to really fucking hate Twitch (as a company) even though I’ve met a lot of people through it.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Restream.io (currently, although I am working on removing dependency on that bot because it is just ugly).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-get-that-large-figlet-font-on-terminal">How do you get that large figlet font on terminal?</h2>
<p>All the fonts that I use are in a <a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/fonts">separate repo</a>. The figlet fonts I’ve collected over the years are all under <code>figlet</code>. I just combine the <code>figlet</code> and <code>lolcat</code> command to get the result you see in these scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/-/blob/master/scripts/figl">figl</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/-/blob/master/scripts/back">back</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The main figlet font I use is <code>future</code>.</p>
