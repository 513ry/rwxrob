Reminded how essential full knowledge of Alpine and BusyBox is for *any*
Cloud Native development and administration. It's even more important
than understanding Ubuntu Linux. Of particularly interest is the fact
that BusyBox only supports POSIX shell and nothing more and that Alpine
uses the `apk` package manager, which is the next most important package
tool to master (after `apt` and before `rpm`).
