Wanna job in cloud-native? Learn go!

Another reason learning Go is really mandatory for any cloud-native
engineer is because documentation of important tools such as `kind`
points *directly* to the Go source code to document structures. This is
even more significant than learning Go `text/template` (which is used in
several essential tools --- particularly that involve filtered output).

I need to add `/todo/<isosec>` to my KEG content list.
