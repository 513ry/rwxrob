Discovered another piece of shit web site: <https://artifacthub.io>
Can't even view the thing without JavaScript enabled. Why are people so
*fucking* stupid?

Opened an [issue] so they can attempt to rationalize their
might-as-well-be-Flash shitty reasons for doing this.

Perhaps that will slow the adoption of this crap. This is an early
project under Cloud Native foundation and could easily become a standard
for distributing Helm charts. That's how I found out about it.
JupyterHub hosts their Helm charts there.

The very fact that we are going down the broke-ass registry path for
charts really worries me. This has been proven over and over to be an
anti-pattern. That is why Go uses just GitHub or any Git repo and
checksums everything. This Helm shit is headed down a very, very bad
road. Clearly, the team does not have long experience with macro
architectural designs that have proven to fail.

God, I fucking *hate* web developers these days. So fucking clueless and
so destroying the Web with this shit. They don't even give a shit that
anyone without JavaScript (including some who have it off for security
and accessibility reasons) can see their site. What kind of uncaring
shit-fuck do you have to be to allow that? Most of them probably promote
crypto-currency in their spare time.
