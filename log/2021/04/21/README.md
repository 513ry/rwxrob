Noticed that the optimal settings to get a Dell Latitude 5411 to display
well from TMUX connected into my main streaming computer are the
following:

* Ubuntu Mono Nerd Font (there's a Windows variation as well)
* Laptop Font Size: 21
* Desktop Font Size: 30

Laptop ends up being 97 width while desktop is 95 but there are no
visible lines or anything if you use my borderless TMUX binary.

66 is the number of thy counting, no more, no less. That is the biggest
a directory name can be without pushing my prompt beyond even being able
to display it on two lines. Lately, I've been prone to create rather
large directory names that match the titles word for word. 66 is a nice
round, evil number.
