That's it. I'm using `x` for my receivers in everything. This variation
based on the name is just plain fucking stupid and impossible to
remember. Using `x` for all my receivers makes everything consistent and
easy to find. Go might not like `this` or `self` but frankly not
standardizing the name of the receiver, not even by convention, is just
fucking brain dead. I don't have to comply.
