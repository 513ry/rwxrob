Now that it has become clear that containers are really the way to do
tech education by bundling everything into a `lab` the questions remains
what to call them, and what are some other simple conventions to keep
things consistent. Here's a start:

* Put them on GitHub (primarily) to find easily
* Name them `lab-` to make the easier to find
* Always include a `README.md`
* Keep the title simple and specific (<=52)
* Start every title with *Learn*
