Three prominent Cloud Native engineers and presenters have now
recommended `kind` for localized development. The developer of `kind`
actually received an award from Cloud Native Foundation one year for it
(even though <https://kubernetes.io> still annoyingly only mentions
`minikube` in all of its learning materials). Hopefully, this will make
dealing with persistent locally mounted volumes easier.
