So [\@juciybit](https://twitch.tv/juciybit) just taught me a new word:
[yak shaving](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=yak+shaving). It's when you solve a larger problems by solving a
bunch of smaller problems that seem irrelevant at the time. Not to be
confused with [bike shedding](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=bike+shedding).

There is a scene from [Malcolm in the
Middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0) about it.

After a few days of "rolling my own" personal productivity tools and
knowledge management scripts I have never been more convinced that
sometimes you actually do get to "reinvent the wheel" because it's
*your* wheel. Obviously, that adage applies to things in the industry
but too often people are hobbled by searching for the perfect tool when
throwing something together quickly with Bash (or whatever their
preferred glue/scripting language is) would be faster and more
sustainable for *them*.

There are *however* several core utilities that make cobbling together
personalized utilities all that much easier:

* Linux 
* Gnome
* `bash`
* `vim`
* `perl`
* `auth`
* `curl`
* `xclip` 
* `jq`
* `yq` 

And these basic data formats:

* Simplified Pandoc Markdown
* YAML
* JSON
