Great initial meeting of The Association of Federated Knowledge Workers.
We had a blast and came up with a bunch of fun names, the most important
of which is KEG, or Knowledge Exchange Grid, which plays out nicely in
many ways:

* KEG Knowledge Base
* KEG Node
* "KEGers" (meetups for knowledge exchange)
* "tapping the KEG for answers"

For more fun stuff <https://github.com/afkworks> has the repos.

I went ahead and secured `keg.network` and `keg.sh` for the group.

Also, I didn't even look if something else is already using the name.
Frankly, I don't give a shit. I'm using it no matter what. It's just too
fucking good not to use.
