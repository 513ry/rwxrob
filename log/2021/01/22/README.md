Looking back at all the initiatives I've attempted over the years I
can't help feeling something different about AFK Workers and especially
KEG. This time I have the backing of a bunch of brilliant "basement
dwellers" and other outliers with the collective experience and insight
I've not been exposed to before.

If nothing more, I don't feel as lonely as before. I have frequently
fought with an internal sense of frustration at having solutions to
things that I just cannot get off the ground, but that is much less
today. People *do* care about the same things that I do. They just are
not tweeting, making videos, and writing ivory tower academic papers
about it that no one will see without paying for them.

Perhaps the simplest way to put this is, I found other people who
actually like to read, who are informed, who care about the world we are
in, and are passionate about seeking solutions despite the overwhelming
odds against us all.

Great initial meeting of The Association of Federated Knowledge Workers.
We had a blast and came up with a bunch of fun names, the most important
of which is KEG, or Knowledge Exchange Grid, which plays out nicely in
many ways:

* KEG Knowledge Base
* KEG Node
* "KEGers" (meetups for knowledge exchange)
* "tapping the KEG for answers"

For more fun stuff <https://github.com/afkworks> has the repos.

I went ahead and secured `keg.network` and `keg.sh` for the group.

Also, I didn't even look if something else is already using the name.
Frankly, I don't give a shit. I'm using it no matter what. It's just too
fucking good not to use.
