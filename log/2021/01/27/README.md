I'm going through a sort of depressed frustration right now with how
long it takes to realize *any* idea. I feel like I'm flooded with them
but don't have the physical capacity to execute on them, not even if a I
had team of a dozen people. It will pass. It always does. 

When people want to understand why I get so pissed at "I'm bored"
comments and broken technologies that slow me down this is why. Every
time I have to open a graphic browser for something I could have
searched and read in fraction of the time in a text browser I lose my
shit because it just reminds me how much the mediocre masses don't give
a shit about such efficiencies.

I've had no less than four different knowledge manager apps in different
forms of Bash and Go over the last five years. I don't bemoan any of it,
but find I keep getting better at identifying what matters most. I've
put the details of latest thinking in a new [`kn`
repo](https://github.com/rwxrob/kn).
