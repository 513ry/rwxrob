GitHub "Education" just denied my renewal as an educational institution
even though ...

* I was a founding member of their group and forum
* I founded a learning community and "educated" hundreds
* My people have flooded me with <https://skilstak.io/referrals>
* I've taught to private schools and community colleges

At first I was so angry I couldn't see straight. 

Then I remembered we are talking about such a dumb-ass culture at
GitHub, one that is okay with sending "Have an Octastic day!" at the end
of their "fuck off" notification with a little emoji in the subject of a
frown crying. How much of a emotional unintelligent ass do you have to
be so not understand that is *not* okay.

I fucking *hate* that GitHub is destroying GitLab's progress on every
front. I want nothing more than to see the culture of GitHub's
collective asshole-ness not be rewarded. 

In fact, I'm thinking of all kinds of ways I can actually just say
goodbye to GitHub entirely. But unfortunately they have a stranglehold
on source hosting now and visibility.

I would move to Source Hut, but not really an option. Just the tilde in
the repo paths is enough to not use it.

Hummm. 

I could do my own. Whitman made that work and did a great job of it.

I need to really think about this one. I at least need to stand up a
Gitea in-house server and evaluate it.

There are other ways to promote software and packages and community
besides buying into any one ecosystem. Linux proved that.

GitHub works because they make things so easy for developers and those
hiring them. But at the end of the day do I *really* need them and their
fucking "octokitty"? 

Hell no. My life is certainly not going to be better because I get more
likes and subscribes on any specific repo, or that I can set my active
status, or that I have "actions" and issues and a stupid-ass wiki. 

It would just feel so fucking good to be free from all the Silicon
Valley bullshit. That feeling might be worth dropping GitHub all by
itself. I bet Digital Ocean might even offer to sponsor host my stuff
for free if we get enough good stuff over there.

I'm angry right now so I need to wait before making any decisions here.
But I'm at least going to get a Kubernetes cluster working with a Gitea
instance running and go from there.
