Only chat streaming for me today. Last night knocked me out. Had to
cancel Beginner Boost. I need some recovery time. Ironic that coding
quietly is one of my best methods to do that.

And another thing, decided given the horrendously bad live chat API at
YouTube that I'll no longer be supporting live chat at all. There's
another *big* reason. After watching [this John Hammond video](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=this John Hammond video) I
noticed something odd. He's chapters appeared on the side where live
chat normally would. Looks like when you incorporate live chat you give
up that ability. So I am just going to make sure that people know about
<https://chat.rwx.gg> and the options with Twitch and Discord. I know
that will be hard because it will still be two windows for some people,
but it is just not worth it to throw away chapter playlists and deal
with the stupid polling chat api for YouTube live chat. They won't be
able to keep that.

I wish I could remember the name of the currency that is in control and
can just be printed more when the country controlling it wants to. It's
not "fiat."
