While discussing the *Developer Advocate* role with some people on the
stream I reflected on my time at Nike where I spend at least half my
time advocating to use SwooshNet (the Intranet web portal I had built)
after having built it. I don't I ever really identified that title in
the role. I *definitely* was a "Developer Advocate" which makes me think
that might be the major role I'm actually looking for next in a
full-time job.
