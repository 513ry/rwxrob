More reasons to hate on GitHub:

* I have to be logged in to search it
* I have to wait through the browser Cloudflare confirmation before I
  can even open anything.

It is so sad to see such a great product fail to completely.

TIL that `readelf` is a thing that I did not know about:

```sh
readelf --all $(which ls)
```

I'm done with `exa` which doesn't even show how many hard links there
are. How fucking brain dead can an `ls` be? Fuck the colors and emojis
if it doesn't have the *base* functionality of the `ls` command.
