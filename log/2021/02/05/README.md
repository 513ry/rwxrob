I am curious to know how long something remains in the Go caching
servers before (and if) it ages out.

TIL that `go mod vendor` and `go build -mod=vendor` will pull any
imported dependencies into the vendor folder so that they are
permanently a part of the source code rather than pulled even with the
saved checksums associated with stuff in `go.mod`.

Realized I cannot use case to distinguish context if I want an interface
that ultimately can be compatible with conversational UIs.
