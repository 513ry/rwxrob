Important changes to KEG root knowledge nodes:

* DEX (formerly MANIFEST) with one line YAML objects but as a node
  itself (DEX/data.yml)
* KEG (formerly a file) with LAST containing timestamp and KEG version
* META and WORDS considered tool helpers and kept outside node
* Nothing not related to knowledge kept in the node
