The default branch in Git is [*still
`master`*](https://github.com/git/git/commit/772bdcd4296b259d52aafb0badd79872e9db3bb3#diff-389fdf0734f87b94f93a073c8217ed866dd0a7afbdee449f388dc548389bc1b0R79).
I'm not changing the default until the Git project does. This decision
has nothing to do with politics, but compatibility with Git.
