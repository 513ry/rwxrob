*to gamestop (v)*: destroying something that is shitty in society or
tech by taking advantage of its flaws and shining a huge light on them
by maximizing everything I can suck out of them for free.

Realized that not having `https` in the URLs when using `lynx` was not
defaulting to it and forcing a redirect that slowed search result
lookups just enough to be annoying to me.

Realized that I have the beginnings of a system-independent, UNIX-like
portable environment contained within a single executable. I was noting
the value of having even simple actions like `date +%s` within `kn`
because it makes them available if I push `kn` to another system even if
it is Windows with no UNIX/Linux shell in sight. Combining a few other
things into it would result in a *single* executable that has all the
wicked fast tools I use to do *everything* making my workspace 100%
portable to any computer, period.

I must be made. I think I found something worth of the `mim` name.

Here's why `kn tstamp` matters:

```json

  "tstamp": "2021-02-20T09:38:03-05:00"
}
```
