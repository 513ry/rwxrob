Time to stop calling learning projects *challenges* and to start calling
them *labs*, which is what they are, an opportunity to change lots of
variables and experiment rather than just pass the challenge. In fact,
this discovery has made me view the word "challenge" pejoratively
forever more. A challenge is something to be met and completed giving
you fame and glory. A lab is something to be done methodically,
experimentally, and with the astute attention of a scrupulous engineer
or scientist. Labs can be done several times and each time something new
can be discovered, learned, and eventually mastered. Repetition *is* the
mother of learning and people don't tend to repeat a "challenge." They
just finish it and get it out of the way.

Words matter, and this discovery really makes me happy.

Here's the book we *really* need:

*Learning Idiomatic Go in the Linux Terminal*

*That* is what is needed, not this shit that assumes "VSCode or Goland"
written by Mac dweebs.
