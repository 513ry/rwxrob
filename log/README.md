# Personal Log and Notes

This is unfiltered Rob, a stream of unedited conciousness that satisfies
my OCD masturbatory urges to write and remember everything that enters
my mind (well, almost everything). Don't expect professional prose nor
judge me to harshly for my momentary, human personal opinions. Nothing
expressed here represents anyone or anything other than my own neurotic
self. Also there are *lots* of spelling and grammar errors. Sorry.
