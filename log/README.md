# Personal Log and Notes

This is unfiltered Rob, a stream of unedited conciousness that satisfies
my OCD masturbatory urges to write and remember everything that enters
my mind (well, almost everything). Don't expect professional prose nor
blame me for my personal opinions. Nothing expressed here represents
anyone or anything other than my own neurotic self.

*Note that the following is contained in an `iFrame`, meaning that it
you should link to the page itself and not this one unless you want to
link to the entry point instead of the log entry itself.*
