Got my little `log` script working that prepends a new entry on the
current log for the current day but that also adds to any other log
entry when adjusted using the `date -d` adjusters.

Really enjoying watching the news on C-SPAN and having a conversation
with people on the live stream. It's amazing how many actually *get* my
really obscure references that practical fall out of my mouth without
thinking, oh yeah, and listening to the people calling in to C-SPAN
(and, yes, making fun of them, a little).
