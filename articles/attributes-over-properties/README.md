I hate the term *properties*. Use *attributes* instead.

I know you are thinking that not even a humble word can escape my hating
rants, but this one cannot.

## I Blame Java

I've never recovered from Java (the programming language). I still have
horrible scars from one of the most brain-dead languages every conceived
mostly because I so deeply bought into all the marketing and OOP crap. 

## Properties Files

Java coders mix up properties when referring to the data in a class (I
think I just threw up a bit in my mouth) and properties files, which are
just long single key=value pairs on each line with ridiculously long
keys that includes dots. They may not have be particularly suitable for
use over a network (like JSON and YAML) but they certainly were specific
and *verbose*.

Here's the thing. I don't hate properties files. In fact, I grew to
really love them and wrote all kinds of libraries for dealing with them.
(Strange how I always seem to get obsessed with data file formats.)

What I do hate is that you cannot use the term properties without
immediately qualifying what you mean. I do so hate lack of clarity in
language (even though I am guilty of it all the time).
