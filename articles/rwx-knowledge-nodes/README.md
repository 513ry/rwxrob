Title: RWX Knowledge Nodes

Since at least as early as 2006 people have been talking about the
proliferation of knowledge through networks of different *knowledge
nodes* but none seem to have directly associated any kind of solution to
directly provide what so many need to manage their knowledge. 

While wondering --- again --- what to call everything I did a random
searching for [knowledge node
network](https://duck.com/lite?kae=t&q=knowledge node network) and was
rewarded with this academic
[article](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2006/1/mapping-knowledge-nodes-networks-and-domains)
discussing the very terms I have been using every day. It seems clear
that at least the terminology is finally solidifying, thank God.

I spend *way* too much time over things like terms and models and domain
names because I want stuff to be memorable and usable.

While I hate the word "brand" I'm back to seriously focusing on
something of an umbrella for all the `kn` work I've been doing. For now
I'm just keeping 'RWX Knowledge Nodes' since it is simple and unique
enough to convey the idea.

I did spend a lot of time moving a bunch of packages out of `rwxrob` and
into `rwx.gg` in the hope that more people will be encouraged to jump in
and help with development eventually.
