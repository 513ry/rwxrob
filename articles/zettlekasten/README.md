Title: Discovered Zettelkasten Today
Subtitle: Remarkably Similar Principles

Summary:
  While Zettlekasten contains many of the fundamental ideas I have been
  batting around and struggling with for the last seven years the most
  striking was their arrival at the idea of "atomicity". This is
  *exactly* the same principle behind component-oriented knowledge bases
  --- specifically a `Component` as is embedded in a `Node` within a
  knowledge `Base`.

I'm super excited to see that many other solutions are popping up
spontaneously in different areas all attempting to address the issue of
personal knowledge management. Most of them are focused on mapping one's
brain in an organized way that can be managed easily, searched, and
shared. But unfortunately none of them has the scope I've envisioned all
along, most recently the `SIGNATURE` addition in order to provide
attribution to every knowledge base.
