  <h2 id=subtitle>Titles are Good Things</h2>
  <p id=summary>Blogging started out as “web logging” and blog entries all just has time stamps. Eventually, people started putting titles on their blog entries. These days we even have <a href="https://duck.com/lite?kae=t&amp;q=art-directed%20blogs">art-directed blogs</a> which is just web speak for fancy magazine articles designed for the web. I’ve always been one to blurt out whatever and just be content to have a time stamp. But recently the inability for me to find my own stuff has caused me to rethink this overall approach. In fact, I’ve concluded titles are good.</p>
<p>Titles provide the fastest way for people to find the topic you are writing about. When I’m too lazy to give a post proper tags and such at least the title will be searchable, both locally and from the web.</p>
<p>I’ve found that this goes for videos as well. These days making a video is so easy you just have to mark it off, highlight it, and export it. I don’t even bother with a description or tags but I do spend time thinking about the absolute perfect title containing the <em>most</em> important keywords.</p>
<p>In fact, as I conclude this short blog entry Imma go make a video about it right now. It just occurred to me that when I create the two at the same time. I can provide a link in the description to the write up of the blog entry that goes with it. That way I save time on the description write up and am always able to formulate the thoughts before I make a video about them, which makes the video better. I’m reminded of a video I watched form Bryan Lunduke where he read from his blog <em>for</em> the video. I suspect that is just the best way to combine “vlogging” with blogging.</p>
